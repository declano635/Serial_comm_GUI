# Serial_comm_GUI
This project simulates a **hardware device communicating over a UART (serial) connection**, verifies received data, and checks for expected responses.

## üìå Overview
This project extends the **UART-based verification system** by adding a **GUI serial monitor** that allows users to:
- **View incoming serial data in real-time**.
- **Send test commands** to the simulated hardware.
- **Log and save serial data** for debugging.

## Step 1: Install Required Python Libraries

Before you begin, install the required Python libraries to simulate serial communication and manage configuration files easily.

Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install pyserial pyyaml

Libraries Used:

pyserial: A Python library to simulate serial communication.

pyyaml: A library to handle test configurations in a YAML format, making it easier to edit and manage.

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Serial Port on macOS

Since we are simulating hardware, we will create a pair of virtual serial ports using socat. This will allow two Python scripts to communicate as if they were connected to actual hardware.


1Ô∏è‚É£ Install socat

Install socat on macOS using Homebrew:

brew install socat


2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Virtual Serial Ports

After installing socat, run the following command in your terminal to create two virtual serial ports:

socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

This command will generate two virtual serial ports. The output will look similar to this:

2024/02/10 12:34:56 socat[12345] N PTY is /dev/ttys004

2024/02/10 12:34:56 socat[12345] N PTY is /dev/ttys005


3Ô∏è‚É£ Take Note of the Virtual Ports

Take note of the two virtual serial devices created by socat (e.g., /dev/ttys004 and /dev/ttys005).

One port will be used by the mock hardware script.
The other port will be used by the test script to simulate communication.

## üöÄ Running the Project

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Mock Hardware
python mock_hardware.py
(Simulates a device sending test data every 2 seconds.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the GUI Serial Monitor
python serial_gui.py
Click "Connect" to start reading data.
Use the input field to send test messages.
Click "Save Log" to save received data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Run the Test Runner
python test_runner.py
Listens for incoming serial data and verifies expected responses.
